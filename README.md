# Design Pattern

* **Creational Design Pattern**

  *  **Purpose** :- to separate the usage of an object from its instanition 
  
  
  1. **Singlton**
     **Purpose** :- ensure that there are only one instance of a type
     
  1. **Prototype**
     **Purpose** :- concerned with cloning of objects
     
  1. **Factory method**
     **Purpose** :- Create object without exposing its type to caller
     
     
     
* **Structural Design Pattern**

  *  **Purpose** :- Define and manage relationship between the objects 
  
  
  1. **Adapter**
     **Purpose** :- Wrap an incompatible type and exposes an interface that’s familiar to the caller
     
  2. **Decorator**
     **Purpose** :- enhance existing types without changing their source code
     
  3. **Façade**
     **Purpose** :-  simplify usage of complex types
     
  4. **Flyweight**
     **Purpose** :- Reduce the memory usage by sharing common data between the objects

  5. **Proxy**
     **Purpose** :- Cloaks an object and postpones time consuming  operations until they are needed
     
     
     
* **Behavioural Design Pattern**

  *  **Purpose** :- Describe  how object  exchange information with each other
  
  
  1. **Chain of responsibility**
     **Purpose** :- Decouple the sender of a request from its receivers
     
  2. **Iterator**
     **Purpose** :- Provide a sequential access to the elements of an aggregate object
     
  3. **Observer**
     **Purpose** :- Lets object subscribe for notification  without any tightly coupled to the sender
     
  4. **State**
     **Purpose** :-  Replace complex conditional logic with an object oriented state machine
